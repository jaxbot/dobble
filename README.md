# Dobble

Dobble was a social networking site I built from scratch during summer 2011.
I based some of the code off of a project I did when I was 14, and hacked and 
rewrote a great deal of code into building an HTML5 social networking site in PHP.

It was a wonderful learning experience, where I figured out the wonders of AJAX,
PHP, MySQL, Linux servers, nginx, websockets, xdebug, email services, HipHop for PHP,
and more.

It was pretty amazing. Mind you, the code is nothing to smile at, and it was built
prior to CSS3 being widely available, so a great deal of the code is unnecessary by
today's standards. But I worked with what I had, and I brought myself closer to where
I am today.

I stumbled across the code for it on my hard drive today, and figured I should read
through it and try and rehabilitate it. I put it up here for record purposes.

It's amazing how far I've come.
